## Project Description
A fun and accessible Python + Flask application that allows you to control your computer's mouse using sound. By detecting claps with your microphone, the application translates these sounds into mouse actions like clicking and scrolling, providing a hands-free way to interact with your system.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Are your hands tired from all that clicking and scrolling? Do you dream of a world where you can command your computer with a simple clap? Well, your dreams are now a reality! This project solves the totally non-existent problem of "mouse fatigue" with a pinch of fun and a dash of absurdity.

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We've developed a genius solution that uses your computer's microphone to listen for claps. One clap performs a left click, two claps scroll up, and three claps scroll down. It's the ultimate hands-free, clap-powered mouse control system that you never knew you needed.
